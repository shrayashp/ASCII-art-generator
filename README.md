# ASCII-art-generator
The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a well known character encoding standard, used for representing text data in computers and electronic communication
In this project, I have created an ASCII Art Generator, which converts images and videos to ASCII art, which has ASCII characters instead of pixels, i.e., the images and videos are pieced together from 70 ASCII characters.
An example is shown below:
